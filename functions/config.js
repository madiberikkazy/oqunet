 * `eur3` — the European multi-region, set in firebase.json. `europe-west1` is
 * the trigger region for it.
 *
 * It is also the right answer for latency. The readers are in Kazakhstan;
 * `us-central1`, the default, would send every registration round trip across
 * the Atlantic and back for no reason.
 *
 * If a deploy ever fails with a region complaint, this constant is the one
 * thing to change — and firebase.json's `firestore.location` is what it has to
 * agree with.
