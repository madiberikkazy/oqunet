/**
 * Push delivery for OquNet.
 *
 * ── Why this is a Cloud Function and not a server ───────────────────────────
 *
 * It used to be a long-lived Express process that held a Firestore listener
 * open and pushed whatever arrived. That design cannot survive the hosting it
 * was on: a free instance sleeps after fifteen minutes of quiet, the listener
 * dies with it, and the cursor that stops a restart re-pushing the whole
 * database also means everything written during the sleep is skipped for good.
 * Notifications would have arrived only while somebody happened to be keeping
 * the process awake.
 *
 * A notification is an *event*, so it is delivered by an event trigger. There
 * is nothing to keep alive, nothing to wake up, no cursor, and no window during
 * which a notification can be missed — Firestore invokes `onNotificationCreated`
 * below, and retries it if it fails.
 *
 * ── The two exports ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   api                     the registration endpoints. A device tells us its
 *                           push token or Web Push subscription; this is what
 *                           VITE_PUSH_SERVER points at.
 *   onNotificationCreated   the delivery itself, one invocation per new
 *                           notification document.
 *
 * The phone-verification webhook stays in server/ — that one really is
 * request/response, and a sleeping instance only makes it slow, not wrong.
