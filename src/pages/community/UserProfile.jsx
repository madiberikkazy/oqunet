/**
 * Another member's profile — the same screen as the reader's own, seen from
 * outside.
 *
 * "The same screen" is meant literally. It is the reader's own layout, in the
 * reader's own order — header, counters, current book, reading week — built
 * from the same components, with the differences all being about who is
 * looking:
 *
 *   · Two buttons the reader's own profile has no use for: follow, and a way
 *     into a conversation.
 *   · No reading-timer launcher. That button starts *your* timer, and it means
 *     nothing on somebody else's page.
 *   · The current-book card is drawn only when there is a book to name. On your
 *     own profile its empty state is an instruction — open the library, borrow
 *     one — and an instruction addressed to somebody who is not reading this
 *     screen is a blank card in the best part of their profile.
 *   · Their posts, under the reading week: it is the one part of a profile that
 *     is theirs to say rather than counted about them.
