/**
 * Which of the three apps is this?
 *
 * The same bundle now ships three ways — a browser tab, an installed PWA, and
 * a Capacitor binary in the two stores — and a handful of things have to be
 * decided differently in the third. Not many: the screens, the router, the data
 * layer and every Firebase call are identical, because a Capacitor app is a
 * WebView running exactly this code. What differs is the seam with the OS, and
 * that seam is what `src/native/` is.
 *
 * The rule for the rest of the app: never branch on the platform at a call
 * site. Import the wrapper from this directory — `share`, `photo`, `browser`,
 * `clipboard` — and let it decide. There is one implementation of "share a
 * link" and it knows about two worlds; there are not fifty screens that each
 * remember to check.
 *
 * `Capacitor.isNativePlatform()` is the only signal worth trusting here. The
 * user agent lies (a WebView reports Chrome or Safari), and `window.Capacitor`
 * exists on web too once the runtime is bundled — it is the *platform* it
 * reports that separates them.
