/**
 * Navigation, as a phone means it.
 *
 * A browser tab has one back affordance and it is the browser's. A phone has
 * two — the Android system back gesture, and whatever the app draws — and they
 * are expected to agree. Getting that agreement is what this file is for; the
 * `useNativeNavigation` hook in bridge.jsx is what installs it.
 *
 * ── The rule ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * System back does what the in-app back arrow does, one step at a time, until
 * there is nothing left to pop. Then — and this is the part a WebView gets
 * wrong on its own — it does *not* navigate the WebView off the app and leave a
 * blank white screen. It either lands on the home tab, or it closes the app.
 *
 * ── Why the tab roots are a special case ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The four tabs are switched with `navigate`, so they stack: Home → Books →
 * Chats leaves three entries, and popping them one by one walks the reader
 * backwards through their own tab history before anything closes. That is
 * correct on the web, where the back button *is* history. It is wrong on a
 * phone, where every app in the drawer treats back from a tab root as "go to
 * the first tab", and back from the first tab as "leave".
 *
 * So: on a tab root, back is a tab decision. Anywhere else, back is a pop.
