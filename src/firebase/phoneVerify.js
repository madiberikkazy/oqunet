/**
 * Proving a phone number, by starting our Telegram bot.
 *
 * The number on a profile is not a detail — it is how a stranger finds the
 * person holding their book, and two screens hand it to somebody about to
 * travel across a city (PickupBook, ReturnBook). So it has to be proven, and
 * the proof has to be something the person typing it cannot fake.
 *
 * ── Where the proof lands ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Not here. The reader opens `t.me/<bot>?start=VERIFY_<TOKEN>` and shares their
 * contact card; Telegram tells the *bot* which account sent it and what number
 * is on it, and nothing the client says is believed. The client's part is
 * reduced to two things it cannot lie its way past:
 *
 *   1. it writes an attempt — "user U claims number P" — under a random token,
 *   2. it waits.
 *
 * The bot matches the token, compares the number on the shared contact against
 * the claim, and writes the profile with the Admin SDK. The security rules
 * refuse `phone` and `phoneVerifiedAt` from any client, so that write is the
 * only way a number can become verified — see `phoneChangeAllowed` in
 * firestore.rules and server/server.js.
 *
 * ── Why Telegram alone ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It was SMS first, which cost money per verification and had a daily ceiling.
 * Then WhatsApp as well, which needs a Meta business review, a signed webhook
 * and a paid message window. Telegram needs a bot token and a free web service,
 * and its contact-sharing button hands over a number the platform itself
 * vouches for. One channel that works beats two that half-do.
 *
 * The trade, stated plainly: a Telegram number is not always the number
 * somebody answers their door on — it is still *a* number they control, which
 * is the property the handover screens actually rely on.
