//
// The point isn't a smaller total — it's a smaller *critical path* plus stable
// cache keys. These libraries only change when we bump a dependency, so keeping
// them out of the app chunk means a routine deploy invalidates a few kB of app
// code instead of ~250 kB of vendor code along with it.
//
// The split lines follow how the code is actually reached:
//   react       — needed to render anything at all.
//   firebase-*  — auth and firestore are both unavoidably on the critical path
//                 (AuthProvider resolves the session before any route can
//                 render), but they're separate packages that version-bump
//                 independently. Storage is dynamically imported by
//                 src/firebase/storage.js, so it lands in a chunk that the vast
//                 majority of sessions never fetch.
//   query       — TanStack Query and its persist adapters, pulled in by main.jsx.
